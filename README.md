Recording Audio Samples:
Recorded 30 audio samples, each containing 35 distinct words.
Used a laptop voice recorder for capturing the audio.

Dataset Preparation:
Compiled the recorded audio samples into a zip archive.
Uploaded the zip file to the working environment.
Extracted the zip file to access the individual audio files for processing.

Data Extraction:
Extracted the dataset from the zip file to a specified directory.
Ensured the audio files were ready for model training by organizing and processing them.

CNN Model Classifier Development:
Selected and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the keyword spotting task.
Configured the CNN model to work with the extracted audio dataset.

Dataset Splitting:
Prepared the dataset for training and testing.
Planned to split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model’s performance.

Fine-Tuning Process:
Initiated the fine-tuning of the CNN model using the prepared dataset.
Applied training data to optimize the model for keyword detection.

Evaluation:
Evaluated the model’s performance based on the dataset’s results.
Addressed initial challenges related to dataset quality and model configuration.

## Challenges Encountered:
Faced limitations due to lack of GPU resources, affecting the ability to complete and optimize the model training process.
Unable to fully fine-tune the model and apply necessary corrections due to computational and time constraints.
